# QE-Calculator
Multipurpose Quantum espresso calculator

## What is it ##
This project is a series of linux scripts and input files written
for the quantum espresso packages. It serves  to optimize the self-consistent field to a degree
of accuracy set at 0.00001%.  Using that information, it then runs the electric band calculate,
phonon dispersion and dielectric functional calculations.

## How does it work ##

(From wikipedia) Quantum ESPRESSO is a suite for first-principles electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling.

This package is created to optimized the self consistant functional calculations to a degree of accuracy, and then automate insertion of input files
into the electric bands, phonon dispersion and and dielectric calculations.
