Quantum-Espresso Calculator package
Spring 2023


!!!	This is an updated solution for the automation which is largely element independant.  The newest improvement is to make it so that only the input file needs to be made, and the rest is unchanged in the main directory.
 
(1)Bands.Config

	- Python Scripts were created by Levi Lentz for MIT and modified by Quantum Nerd.  The only two modifications to the original script is naming the input file (siliconbands.dat) and turning off show plot function.
	
   	- Bandsconfig.in is a file used for the purpose of running bands.x  It will create the siliconbands.dat file used in running the run.py plottingscript mentioned above.
	
   *	- Bands.append is a file used to append information to the Si.SCF.in file
when running band calculations with pw.x.  The Si.SCF.in file get's altered within the 
script to change various running parameters and adding this structure to the end 
of the file.
	
	
(2)Dielectric.Config

	- EeldvsEV.gnu and EpsvsEV.gnu are both gnu plot files to meant to take information for output files from running various programs (pw.x, epsilon.x, etc) and plot them with the listed parameters in gnuplot.  EpsvsEV.gnu is using two distinct files, one for imaginary epsilon values and one for real epsilon values.
	
   	- eps.in is the input file for running epislon.x  This file changes for each different element and has to be generated by hand.  It is used to generate data for the EpsvsEv graph.
   

(3)InputFiles

	- These files are the input files from that describe the element your using.  Each one has to be generated individually and will be altered through out the runs.  They should always be made as SCF files and (during a full run) will be optimized for the accuracy of energy you want, the size of the kpoint grid and cell diameter.

	
(4)Phonon.config

	- DispersionRelation.plot.gnu and DOS.plot.gnu (density of states) are both plotting files that instruct gnuplot how to plot the output from other files
	
	- There are two matdyn input files, one for an automtic kpoint grid, and one for a non automatic kpoint grid.  They are used for different graphs, so it's important to have them both exist.  The non uniform kpoint grid (matdyn.nonUniform.in) does need to be created by hand.  Primairly it's just the Kpoint grid that needs to be added in.
	
	- ph.in is the input file for ph.x and is used to generate the dyn files that are used for the proceedig programs to run.  The information is automtically updated.  The prefix is changed every run, as well as the automic mass (amass).
	
	- q2r.in is the input file for q2r.x, it relies on the dyn files generated by ph.x.  The only thing that gets changed every run is that is updates the file names with the proper prefix. 
	
	
(5)PseudoPotentials

	- These files are pseudo potentials generate by various people and companies.  They can be found online, there is no need to do anything about them add more as you need.  Your input file needs to have the exact name of the pseudo potential file, and the pseudo directory section of your input files should link to this folder.


(6)SCF.config

	- There are several .gnu files, these are for various graphs made while running interations of the SCF calculations.  All these files are automated, and require nothing of the user.
	The only specific .gnu file to call attention to is the liveplot.gnu, this is the window that opens while running the SCF calculations, and there are a few modifications you may wish to make.
	(1) For some computers, the reread speed can cause the live graph to flicker slightly.  Increasing this number makes that significantly more bearable.  When running longer calculations, you can even put it up to refreshing every minute.
