!!!	The references in this file are done with the Silicon files and dat as an example.  The setups and configurations are the same regardless of the element used, only the information in the files are changed.  To locate data based on the element you are using, just search for the corresponding prefix for the element (i.e., Si for silicon, Al for aluminum,etc).

!!! Any place in this file that you see a star ahead of a file name means that it is NOT automatically generated.  This is a full list of files and their generation in the user guide.
 
(1)Bands.Config

	- Python Scripts were created by Levi Lentz for MIT and modified by Quantum Nerd.  The only two modifications to the original script is naming the input file (siliconbands.dat) and turning off show plot function.
	
   *	- Si.Bandsconfig.in is a file used for the purpose of running bands.x  It will create the siliconbands.dat file used in running the run.py plottingscript mentioned above.
	
   *	- Si.Bands.append is a file used to append information to the Si.SCF.in file
when running band calculations with pw.x.  The Si.SCF.in file get's altered within the 
script to change various running parameters and adding this structure to the end 
of the file.
	
	
(2)Dielectric.Config

	- EeldvsEV.gnu and EpsvsEV.gnu are both gnu plot files to meant to take information for output files from running various programs (pw.x, epsilon.x, etc) and plot them with the listed parameters in gnuplot.  EpsvsEV.gnu is using two distinct files, one for imaginary epsilon values and one for real epsilon values.
	
   *	- Si.eps.in is the input file for running epislon.x  This file changes for each different element and has to be generated by hand.  It is used to generate data for the EpsvsEv graph.
   

(3)InputFiles

	- These files are the input files from that describe the element your using.  Each one has to be generated individually and will be altered through out the runs.  They should always be made as SCF files and (during a full run) will be optimized for the accuracy of energy you want, the size of the kpoint grid and cell diameter.

	
(4)Phonon.config

	- 
	
	
(5)PseudoPotentials

	- These files are pseudo potentials generate by various people and companies.  They can be found online, there is no need to do anything about them add more as you need.  Your input file needs to have the exact name of the pseudo potential file, and the pseudo directory section of your input files should link to this folder.
